# Support-Vector-Machines---Linear-Classification

__Support Vector Machines__ are a popular type of __Supervised Learning__ algorithm. They perform well on smaller datasets and are thus a viable alternative when there is not enough data to train an algorithm which is data hungry like a __deep net__. They can be used for both __Classification__ and __Regression__ tasks in __Scikit-Learn__.

In this post, concepts on how they work with a __Linear Kernel__ are explained including __Margins__, __Support Vectors__, and __Kernels__. Examples are given for both binary and multi-class classification. More complexity is added with __Pipelines__ and __Randomised Grid Search Cross-Validation__ in the later examples.
